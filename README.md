SoftwareCertificates
Repository for Software Certs for easy software blocking (or allowing) across corp environments, for example, using MDE IOC/AppLocker/WDAC

e.g. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/indicator-certificates?view=o365-worldwide


Caution: Some Certs for unsanctioned applications may be used for other applications from the same org that may be legitimate e.g. BlueJeans Conferencing (sanctioned) BlueJeans Remote Desktop Control (unsanctioned)

please do not bulk upload these certs without checking, chances are it will break your environment!

For what its worth personally WDAC >>>> Applocker

App Ref: https://appwiki.checkpoint.com/appwikisdb/public.htm  or https://getintopc.com/all-software-categories/

Also See A good article on abusing code signing certs: https://axelarator.github.io/posts/codesigningcerts/  

Of course there are ways around Cert Blocking (e.g. ImageRemoveCertificate API, signTool, SigThief, delcert - more opportunities for detectionðŸ˜‰) 

Useful Ref For Programs people install on fresh desktop: https://ninite.com/ (also worth blocking ninite's cert)
